But Israel didn't do it, the hospital itself wasn't bombed and hundreds of people didn't die (see other Tweets from Oct. 17, 2023 on this site to view the entire elaborate hoax). The hospital's parking lot was bombed by Palestinian terror group Islamic Jihad misfiring a missile aimed at Israel. This Tweet is still up two years later, and Doctors Without Borders has never clarified or corrected it.",
