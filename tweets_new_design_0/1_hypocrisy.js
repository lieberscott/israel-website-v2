But when America signed a security commitment with Qatar three months later, promising 'the United States will take all legal and appropriate measures - including diplomatic, economic, and if necessary, military,' against anyone who attacks Qatar, these same voices never said 'I'm not fuckin' dying for Qatar.' And this security arrangemnet with Qatar, the U.S. doesn't even have with Israel.",
