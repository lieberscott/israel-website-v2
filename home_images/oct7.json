    "text": "It's a story about murdered love. A heartbreaking story about Yvonne and Antonio. They met at a Colombian party, he saw her and fell in love and they became inseparable. They were happy people, it is said that they were like a ray of sunshine that shone on everyone around them. Each of them ended up in a relationship with a child and they became one warm and happy family. They went to the Nova music festival with some friends, they left the children with Antonio's parents. When the shooting started, she called her brother and told him in a frightened and terrified voice: \"They are shooting at us!, they are shooting at us! They are blowing us up\". The family then tried to call them several times but she did not answer anymore. In the shelter, grenades were thrown at them, they were seriously injured when a terrorist entered and shot all the wounded repeatedly. A survivor from the shelter said that Antonio was slowly dying for several hours. They had no chance. The two small children were waiting for them at home, Antonio's 7-year-old daughter Manuela and Yvonne's 4 and a half-year-old son Aviel. For many days they did not know what had become of them until the news arrived. The social workers and psychologists told the children that mom and dad had died. It's a sad story, about Yvonne and Antonio who loved to dance salsa, loved to be happy and entertain. But most of all they loved little Manuela and Aviel. It's a story about a family that Hamas monsters murdered in an instant, it's a story about small children crying. This is a story about Antonio and Yvonne - in life and in death they were inseparable."

She really loved her garden in the small apartment where she lived in Ofakim and every day until the last day she would go out to the garden and tend it. This is a story about yelizbeta who always took care of those around her, was very caring and loving. On October 7 at 06:40 she sent her daughter a message: \"Rita, there are a lot of alarms and booms and there is nothing on the news. It is dangerous for the neighbors who have to take small children out so early in the morning and stand in a stairwell during the alarms\". yelizbeta did on that terrible morning what she had done all her life - cared for others. She decided to go open the door and call the neighbors to come and hide from the missiles in the protected room of her house. But when yelizbeta opened the door, a ruthless Hamas monster murdered her with unimaginable brutality and left her bleeding to death in the doorway of her house. yelizbeta had no chance, she never reached the neighbors. This is a story about the 78-year-old yelizbeta, who was a complete world. She loved her family, had a big heart, was wise, modest and had a charming smile. This is a story about yelizbeta, who never hurt anyone, yelizbeta that in the terrifying moments of the morning of October 7th thought of others and most of all, she wanted to live."

Shani did not know that in those minutes thousands of armed terrorists infiltrated the festival area. Near road 232 there were mortar shells falling, Shani and her friends were directed to enter the shelter on the side of the road. They immediately did so, only they had no idea that in a few minutes, they would go through hell. When they went inside, terrorists arrived and started throwing grenades at them inside the shelter. Shani and her friends repelled the first grenades and when they already thought the nightmare was over, the terrorists sprayed them with gunfire. At a certain point the terrorists stopped the shooting and pulled out those who remained alive. The terrorists grabbed Shani and her roommate who came with her to the party and dragged them wounded and bleeding into the van. Shani came to the festival to celebrate the role she got in a new job she was accepted to. After long days of searching, uncertainty and endless worry, the family received the bitter news.  The terrorists murdered her and her roommate in a van on the way to Gaza with unimaginable cruelty. Imagine this, being held captive in a two meter shelter, surviving a grenade attack and close range shooting, being injured, kidnapped and then brutally murdered along the way. Imagine the last moments of Shani, who had a whole life ahead of her, and especially many dreams that she would never fulfill. Rest in peace Beautiful Girl, no one will hurt you anymore."
