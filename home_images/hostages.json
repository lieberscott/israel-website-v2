I will take only a few items: chocolate milk that my daughters love, shoes that are good for running, and a new bandage for Ela ‚Äî the last photograph we have of her in captivity shows that she is injured. Take me to Gaza so I can change her bandage.\n\nIn my jeans pocket I will carry a photograph of Noam, their father, who we believe was killed in front of their eyes.
