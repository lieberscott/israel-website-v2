    "text": "There are several issues that I have with this video clip\n\n1. Israeli army is right now about 6-7 kilometers away from the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone (see the recent map from January 21 below), the ground forces of IDF are not in Al Mawasi or anywhere near. There is no existing sniper rifle that can cover that long range (mostly they are good for along shot between 1000-1500 meters, rarely slightly farther)\n2. We can hear automatic gun fire in the video, not a single shot fire that sniper rifle produces, which implies we hear a machine gun fire (like M-16 or Kalashnikov) and effective range for those are between 500 to 550 meters for M-16 and 350 meters for Kalashnikov.\n3. The clip is edited between the time we hear gunshots and we see the body - it misses several seconds of the footage and these are important seconds, because during these seconds the person was hit with a bullet\n4. We do not see on the video any armed person, we do not have a clear visual on the body either, the angle does not allow us to see where he was hit and from which direction, what we see is that he is covered with a white piece of cloth and dragged to a nearby area behind the fence\n\nOverall: we do not have enough data to reach any conclusion on who shot him right now"

    "text": "Hi, I‚Äôm a lawyer. Do want to know what is really meant by a ‚Äú#proportionate response‚Äù under international law? Then read on - and feel free to ask questions!\n\nUnder International Humanitarian Law, #proportionality requires that any degree of damage (up to and including death) to #civilians not be ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù in relation to the ‚Äúmilitary advantage anticipated from a strike against a military target.‚Äù\n\nWe are going to break that down, so everyone understands what exactly that means.\n\nHowever, first, you should be aware that it is a misnomer that anytime #Palestinian civilians die after an #Israeli strike, it is automatically evidence of an Israeli war crime. This is completely false - the law does not work that way.\n\nSimply, and unfortunately, the international rules of law recognize that civilians are often killed during war; and, most of the time, those deaths are actually not indicative of a war crime.\n\nInstead, the legal test for ‚Äúproportionality‚Äù requires that each individual strike be looked at with a particular balancing analysis.\n\nFirst, here is a hard and fast rule: the strike must be intended to target a military objective; it is, therefore, an unlawful war crime to strike with the intent of targeting civilians without any military objective whatsoever.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs get a little technical while still keeping it simple.\n\nUnder the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1977 at both Article 51(5)(b) and Article 52(2), we know that when #Hamas uses its own population (or Israeli #hostages) as #humanshields - either by using them to shield themselves or to shield their weapons depots - Hamas has, under international law, turned civilians targets into military targets.\n\nThat means that when Hamas places weapons caches in and under schools, hospitals, mosques, etc., Hamas has made each of those places legitimate military targets.\n\nSo, it has been well-known for many years that Hamas purposefully placed its headquarters underground beneath the al-Shifa Hospital. In doing so, international law holds that the hospital is no longer just a civilian target, it is a legitimate military target.\n\nThat does not necessarily give the IDF carte blanche to attack hospitals, schools, mosques, etc.; however, it does mean that an IDF attack on a civilian target that has been made into a military target by Hamas‚Äô use of human shields is not per se illegal under international law.\n\nInstead, such a strike (as is the case with any strike conducted by a military like the IDF), must be analyzed through a balancing test.\n\nOne part of this balancing test performed by Israel before each strike is to determine whether the human shields in question are being used voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\nIf the human shields are being used voluntarily - meaning the human shields are there protecting Hamas and its weapons of their own volition - then the target remains a completely legitimate military target.\n\nIf the human shields are being used involuntarily - meaning Hamas is forcing people to act as human shields to protect themselves and/or their weapons - then the IDF must go back to the balancing test to determine whether the anticipated military advantage of a successful strike would outweigh the reasonably anticipated loss of civilian life.\n\nImportantly, the IDF rules state that if it cannot determine whether a human shield is being used voluntarily or involuntarily, it must presume the civilian is being used against his or her own will and treat the civilians as an involuntary participant.\n\nAssuming that there is a military target & that there may be human shields that are there involuntarily, the next step in the proportionality analysis for each individual strike (remember, proportionality is determined on a strike-by-strike basis, and not as the accumulation of strikes over time) is to try to determine the likely amount of damage to civilian persons and/or property as a result of the strike.\n\nIn other words, under international law, Israel must be able to give a sort of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù to the anticipated impact on civilians (including potential civilian deaths). Simply, a smaller number of anticipated civilian casualties may make the strike proportionate if there is a significant military advantage to be gained by conducting the strike.\n\nHowever, if Israel determines that the anticipated impact of a strike may cause many civilian casualties, it must make the difficult determination of whether the anticipated military advantage is so significant that it warrants carrying out the strike anyway.\n\nSo, if Hamas has a weapons depot underneath a house with two civilians inside, and that house has been used to fire 500 rockets at Israeli civilians, and it is reasonably expected that there are hundreds more rockets under that house, Israel can almost certainly carry out the strike within the confines of international law.\n\nIf that same house, however, had 10 families living inside, including many children, it could - and likely would - tip the scales of the proportionality balancing test toward Israel not being permitted to carry out the strike, even though the house has been used to attack Israeli civilians and can be expected to continue to be used to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians.\n\nNow, that balancing test can always change. If that same house is being used to fire long-range, precision-guided missiles at Israel‚Äôs major population centers in places like #TelAviv (effectively putting millions of Israeli civilians in danger), the balancing test may tip back in favor of Israel being legally permitted to carry out the strike.\n\nThis all suggests the third and final step in the proportionality balancing test: the #IDF must determine and place a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù on the anticipated military advantage that would be gained if it were to carry out a particular strike.\n\nAn attack on Hamas leadership and/or its weapons manufacturers would be considered a high value target. An attack on a single Hamas member who has no special skill, would be a much lower value military target.\n\nSimilarly, an attack on a small cache of mortars would have less military value that an attack on a large cache of advanced rockets that can reach large Israeli civilian population centers.\n\nOnce the @IDF determines the anticipated ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the likely effect on civilian persons and property and the anticipated ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the likely military advantage to be gained if the strike is carried out, the balancing test can be performed, and a certain amount of judgment must go into the determination of whether that strike would or would not be ‚Äúproportionate.‚Äù\n\nImportantly, this decision is so vital that the IDF does not simply permit a single solder on the ground with his or her hand on the proverbial (or actual) ‚Äútrigger‚Äù to make that determination.\n\nIn fact, the decision of whether a strike is proportionate is not even left up to IDF officers. It‚Äôs not even left up to IDF Generals.\n\nInstead, before any IDF strike can take place, IDF Guidelines provide that the proportionality balancing test must be presented to and analyzed by IDF military lawyers who then determine whether the strike is legally permissible as ‚Äúproportionate‚Äù under international law and the rules of war.\n\nAnd these IDF military lawyers are not mere patsies or people who simply ‚Äúrubber stamp‚Äù what the IDF requests.\n\nIn fact, the IDF‚Äôs military lawyers work entirely independently of the IDF. They are outside of the chain of command and do not answer to anyone in the IDF, including a General (for example).\n\nPlus, every IDF military lawyer knows he or she may very well be held to account if he or she makes a wrong decision based on the evidence available at the time.\n\nFurthermore, sometimes the decisions to be made while balancing the likely military advantage against the likely civilian casualties can be so difficult that the legality of the strike is first brought to the Israeli Supreme Court for instant review.\n\nAnother important concept: the comparison of civilian body counts of #Israelis versus #Palestinians (to the extent those numbers can be trusted since they come directly from Hamas-only) is not relevant to a proportionality analysis. Each strike must be viewed individually to determine proportionality. It is not a test of the cumulative nature of the strikes.\n\nAlso, by simply comparing body counts, it does not factor in how many people killed were actually #HamasTerrorists, how many were Hamas collaborators there voluntarily, and it does not consider what military advantage was gained by Israel carrying out any individual strike.\n\nAs Israel is now in the process of seeking to secure the military advantage of preventing Hamas from having the capacity to carry out repeated attacks of the kind and nature seen on October 7th, Israel is permitted to act proportionately insofar as necessary to achieve that military objective (the elimination of Hamas and/or its ability to make war).\n\nOne more important fact people do not know, but that they should know: according to UN statistics of global conflict, the average civilian to combatant killed ratio is a rather appalling nine civilians killed for every one combatant killed.\n\nThat‚Äôs why civilian body counts in and of themselves are never indicative of a war crime. Each individual strike has to be analyzed, and unfortunately civilians always suffer disproportionately in wars.\n\nIn fact, while Israel is routinely criticized for any of its strikes that kill civilians, you may be surprised to know that Israel‚Äôs civilian to combatant ratio is routinely much lower than the nine to one average.\n\nIn the very last operation carried out by the IDF prior to October 7 (in Jenin), 0.6 civilians were killed for every one combatant killed.\n\nIn that conflict, not only were the IDF‚Äôs ratio numbers nowhere near the nine to one international average, but the IDF actually managed to kill more combatants than civilians - something that is extremely rare.\n\nIn truth, Israel is targeted by accusations of war crimes almost immediately by the media, by politicians, and by the UN General Assembly despite the fact that those accusations are near 100% of the time based neither in fact nor in law.\n\nSince a proportionality balancing test must be used to determine whether a single specific Israeli strike falls within the confines of international law, someone providing an analysis must have all of the facts Israel considered before carrying out that strike as to the anticipated impact on civilians and the anticipated military advantage. Obviously, anyone who is making a snap judgment critical of Israel could not possibly have that information.\n\nUnderstand then, that when you see talking heads accusing Israel of ‚Äúwar crimes‚Äù immediately after and/or during Israeli strikes, that is not an actual legal analysis under international law of what constitutes a war crime.\n\nMuch more likely, what you are witnessing is part of Hamas‚Äô ongoing psychological and propaganda warfare campaign of demonizing and delegitimizing the State of Israel in the eyes of public opinion.\n\n#Hamas_is_ISIS #HamasisISIS #HamasISIS #HamasMonsters #October7massacre"

    "text": "Hi, lawyer here again. You‚Äôve heard Israel has a right to \"self-defense,\" but you may have noticed politicians & media stars disagree on what Israel is permitted to do in #SelfDefense. Want to know how international law really defines the limits of ‚Äúself-defense?‚Äù Then read on.\n\n‚ÄúSelf-Defense‚Äù Under International Law\n\nSelf-defense is the most basic legal right afforded to all sovereign nations.\n\nUnder both customary international law & Article 51 of the #UN Charter, all countries acknowledge one another‚Äôs ‚Äúinherent right‚Äù to self-defense against armed attack.\n\nYou may hear some claim Israel‚Äôs self-defense is limited to what he or she claims is ‚Äú#proportionate‚Äù to the #HamasMassacre of October 7-only. That is incorrect.\n\nIsrael‚Äôs right to self-defense under international law continues until it has eradicated the ongoing threat of further attacks by #Hamas.\n\nWhy? Well, the #October7massacre was only the latest & most deadly #TerroristAttack by Hamas against Israel.\n\nHamas‚Äô Goals Stated in its Charter\n\nFor anyone paying attention, Hamas does not hide its intentions. Its raison d‚Äô√™tre is expressly stated in its 1988 Charter, which includes the following (just a few examples):\n\n(1) Hamas is in a worldwide religious ‚Äústruggle against the #Jews‚Äù;\n\n(2) Hamas intends to ‚Äúraise the banner of #Allah over every inch of Palestine‚Äù (‚Äúfrom the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea‚Äù) where it plans an Islamic Caliphate; and\n\n(3) Hamas vows no #peace with Israel, claiming ‚ÄúPalestine is an #Islamic land.‚Äù\n\nHamas‚Äô Early Attempts to Thwart Peace with Terror\n\nHamas has been carrying out terror attacks against Israeli civilians for ~35 years.\n\nTo help kill the 1993 & 1995 ‚ÄúOslo Accords‚Äù in the cradle, Hamas carried out & celebrated multiple terror attacks, just a few of which include:\n\n(1) Oct 19, 1994: suicide bomber murdered 22 Israeli civilians & wounded 56 on a public bus in Tel Aviv;\n\n(2) Feb 25, 1996: suicide bomber murdered 26 Israeli civilians & wounded 80 on a public bus in Jerusalem; and\n\n(3) Feb 25-March 4, 1996: three Hamas suicide bombings in seven days murdered 65 Israeli civilians & wounded 164 (two on public busses in Jerusalem & one in Tel Aviv‚Äôs largest shopping mall).\n\nCamp David 2000 & the Second Intifada\n\nAt Camp David in 2000, U.S. #President Bill Clinton hosted #Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak & Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to finalize a peace agreement.\n\nBarak accepted the \"Clinton Parameters\" & agreed to recognize a Palestinian state on 100% of the Gaza Strip & up to 97% of the #WestBank (with land swaps to make up for the remaining ~3%) with East #Jerusalem as its capital in return for ‚Äúthe end of belligerency and any further claims.‚Äù\n\nArafat rejected the offer.\n\nArafat made no counter offer.\n\nArafat, instead, ordered the Second #Intifada.\n\nArafat released dozens of Hamas & Islamic #Jihad terrorists from #Palestinian jails & made a strategic return to #terrorism.\n\nThe Second Intifada saw bloody, almost-daily terrorist attacks for ~five years, during which more than 1,000 Israeli civilians were murdered.\n\nIn fact, more than 200 terror attacks were carried out against Israeli civilians between May 2003-July 2004 alone.\n\nThe constant terror - especially in response to Israel‚Äôs offer of peace & a Palestinian state - left scars on Israeli society that remain to this day.\n\n2005 - Israel Withdrew from Gaza Entirely & Hamas Took Over\n\nIsrael believed it had no \"peace partner\" in the PA, so Prime Minister Ariel Sharon adopted a ‚Äúdisengagement plan‚Äù from #Gaza in 2005, which saw Israel forcibly remove 9,000 Israelis living in 21 Jewish settlements in Gaza and dismantle 38 synagogues, 42 daycare centers, 36 kindergartens, seven elementary schools, and three high schools at a total cost of ~$900 million. Israel even dug up all Jewish graves and moved them out of Gaza.\n\nThere was no #siege & no #blockade - Gaza was under the complete control of the PA.\n\nBut here is a general overview of the unfortunate two years post-disengagement:\n\nSept 12, 2005: not a single Jew - alive or dead - was left in Gaza; PA took control.\n\nSept 23, 2005: Hamas fired 40 rockets at Israeli civilians in Sderot.\n\nJan 25, 2006: PA Legislative elections resulted in a Hamas victory.\n\nMarch 29, 2006: Hamas formed PA government under arch-terrorist Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nJune 25, 2006: Hamas terrorists crossed from Gaza into Israel, murdered two, wounded two, & kidnapped Gilad Shalit.\n\nFeb 8, 2007: Hamas and Fatah (PA President Mahmoud #Abbas‚Äô organization) agreed to share power; Hamas reiterated it would ‚Äúnever‚Äù recognize Israel.\n\nJune 10-14, 2007: Hamas murdered or exiled every Fatah member from Gaza in a bloody coup.\n\nOnce the #genocidal Hamas terror organization completed it takeover of Gaza, both Israel & #Egypt (which also shares a border with Gaza) placed a ‚Äúblockade‚Äù on Gaza that attempted to restrict smuggling of weapons & terrorists.\n\nHamas Terror & Israeli Responses\n\nAfter Hamas fired more than 10,000 rockets & mortars at Israeli civilians, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead in 2008; but international pressure forced Israel to end the operation with a ‚Äústalemate‚Äù #ceasefire instead of destroying Hamas.\n\nIn 2012, after Hamas continued to rain thousands of rockets on Israeli civilians, Israel launched Operation Pillar of Defense; but international pressure forced Israel to end the operation with a ceasefire.\n\nIn 2014, Hamas was still firing thousands of rockets on Israeli civilians, and Israel launched Operation Protective Edge; again, international pressure forced Israel to end its operation with a ceasefire.\n\nIn 2021, Hamas fired six rockets on Jerusalem (an Israeli ‚Äúred line‚Äù) and then fired hundreds of rockets aimed at Israeli civilian population centers, including #TelAviv. Israel launched Operation Guardian of the Walls; but, again, international pressure forced Israel to end its operation with a ceasefire.\n\nOct 7, 2023: ~3,000 Hamas terrorists & their collaborators infiltrated Israel & committed mass atrocities including mutilations, rapes, torture, & murder of Israeli men, women, children, the elderly, the infirm, & infants. More than 1,200 Israelis were murdered, ~8,000 were wounded, and ~240 were kidnapped.\n\nExtent of Israel‚Äôs Legal Right to Self-Defense\n\nIsrael‚Äôs legal right to self-defense permits it to do everything ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù to ensure Hamas can never attack Israeli civilians again.\n\nAt a minimum, this is because of: (1) the genocidal brutality of Oct 7; (2) Hamas‚Äô history of genocidal warfare against Israel & Jews; and (3) Hamas‚Äô express commitment to repeat massacres like Oct 7 ‚Äúover and over.‚Äù\n\nThus, Israel‚Äôs right to ‚Äúself-defense‚Äù extends beyond just stopping Hamas‚Äô immediate attacks (it still fires rockets daily at Israel), it permits Israel to completely eradicate Hamas‚Äô military capability.\n\nOne way to think of how/why it is ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù for Israel to destroy Hamas‚Äô military capability in self-defense is to understand countries not only have the right to eliminate threats to their civilian population, but they also have the right to restore a sense of security.\n\nOn October 7, Hamas shattered Israel‚Äôs sense of security since Hamas showed it had the capability to defeat Israel‚Äôs defensive measures.\n\nIsrael had invested heavily in defensive-only military capabilities such as building the #IronDome system that intercepts the majority of rockets fired from Gaza & by constructing bomb shelters across the country.\n\nHowever, on October 7, Hamas got around Israel‚Äôs defenses & carried out a genocidal massacre.\n\nAs a result, Israel is legally justified under international law to take necessary action in self-defense by completely destroying Hamas‚Äô ability to make war or commit atrocities again by doing things such as: (1) capturing or killing Hamas‚Äô command & control; (2) destroying Hamas‚Äô combat capabilities by taking out operatives, launch sites, & military equipment; and (3) taking steps to prevent Hamas from reconstituting & rearming.\n\nOne additional thing to keep in mind with regard to Israel‚Äôs legal right to self-defense is the possibility that Israel could extend this right to #Iran given its role as the main sponsor of Hamas in both weapons and terror training.\n\nWhether Israel thinks it is a good idea to strike Iran directly remains to be seen; however, it is clear that Israel would be legally justified in doing so in order to stop Iran from funding attacks against its civilians.\n\n#Education #Israel #Palestine"
